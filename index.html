    <p>I do this for a reason that they can't pretend to glean
I lose myself infused in something more than what they've seen
I'm not a slave to greed
I don't embrace your make believe
I've never been for sale no matter what they think I need
So let it be decreed
Let this music serve the deed
Let it spread like a disease
Let it spawn a noble seed

There's more than meets the eye
There's more than meets the price
If you can't see the sky there's too much artificial light
I can't predict my path, but they can't fully see my past
I'm running from the flash but heading straight inside the blast
A mountain full of ego built upon a heap of trash
Is exactly what you get when you can't fully do the math

This is not the right way (16x)
But this is my way (16x)
